Walking through coding examples of LearnReact

## 02/15/2024
This is me learning React by following the examples and steps listed in "Learning React" by Kirupa Chinnathambi.

Things I learnt today:
1. Single Page Applications (Modern) vs Multiple Page Applications.
2. Two ways to create React Apps:
  i.  Setup a Node development environment + build tools: Transcribe JSX to JS locally and then put them on the server - Faster.
  ii. Let the browser (client) convert JSX to JS at runtime - Slower but less ramp.
